# crack_segmentation_model_in_buildings_and_roads

## Overview
The Crack Segmentation Project focuses on **automated detection and segmentation of cracks** in concrete and road surfaces using deep learning techniques.  
The project implements a **U-Net-based segmentation model** trained on annotated crack datasets, helping infrastructure engineers automate inspection and maintenance tasks.

## Dataset

### 1. CRACK500 Dataset
- **Source:** [CRACK500 dataset](https://github.com/cool-mist/CRACK500)  
- **Content:** 500 images of concrete surfaces with cracks, each annotated with pixel-wise masks.  
- **Purpose:** Train the model to segment cracks accurately in varying lighting and surface conditions.  
- **Image Types:** RGB images, `.jpg` format  
- **Mask Types:** Binary masks, `.png` format  
- **Folder Structure:**
```
- data/
├─ train/ # Training images
├─ test/ # Testing images
masks/
└─ train/ # Ground truth masks for training
```

### 2. Preprocessing
- Images resized to 256x256 pixels  
- Normalized pixel values to [0,1]  
- Data augmentation applied (optional): rotation, flipping, and brightness adjustment
